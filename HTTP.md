Earlier web page was all about: HTML(format to represent content), HTTP(protocol to transfer this content), www(first browser ehre client can see this content), server(where this doc can exist)

1. HTTP(0.9) was all about GET request
2. HTTP(1.0): header in request, content-type in header, status code for broswer to use whether cache to be served
3. HTTP(1.1): Resources embedded in a HTML no need to call a new request, Pipeline added for async request sent an not to wait for prevs resulting in low latency
  Chunked responses were also supported.
  Additional cache control mechanisms were introduced.
  Content negotiation, including language, encoding, and type, was introduced. A client and a server could now agree on which content to exchange.
  Thanks to the Host header, the ability to host different domains from the same IP address allowed server collocation.(HOST is server address)
4. HTTP(2.0): binary protocol rather than a text protocol. multiplexed protocol(parallel request for same connection)
5. HTTP(3.0) runs on UDP instead of TCP saving latency
